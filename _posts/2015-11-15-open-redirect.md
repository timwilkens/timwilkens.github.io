title: Open Redirects
---

I have heard of open redirects before sincethey frequently show up on lists of top vulnerabilities, but I had never really taken the time to understand what kind of problems they can cause. After reading the short post on [owasp](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect) I now know that the primary use is in phishing attacks. If a well known site has an open redirect vulnerability an attacker could use the name recognition of that site to trick someone into clicking on a link that redirects somewhere malicious.
