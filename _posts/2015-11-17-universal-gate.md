title: Universal Gates
---

I started going through the Coursera course on [Hardware Security](https://class.coursera.org/hardwaresec-008/) this morning and was introduced to logic gates. Most of the operations are familiar to me as a programmer and I have also seen the operations when I took a Symbolic Logic class at UCSD. However, I had never heard of the concept of a [universal gate](http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/COE/elrabaa/coe200/Lessons/Lesson2_6.pdf). Briefly, a universal gate is a logic gate that can be used to express *all* logical operations, or put another way

> A universal gate is a gate which can implement any Boolean function without need to use any other gate type.

I found this idea to be really interesting and a cool demonstation of the way that [pure theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness) can be of great practical use.
